# React Getty Image Search

This application searches for images using [Getty Images APIs](http://developers.gettyimages.com/docs/) and does a simple spell check before requesting the data.

Dictionary text file was taken from [gwicks](http://www.gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm) (English).

You can find a working [demo](https://pn-getty-image-search.herokuapp.com/) hosted on Heroku.<br>

Make sure to replace your Getty Images api-key in `config/credentials.json`.
